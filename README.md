ToDo List app is a simple listing app for your daily tasks.

## Getting Started

It's a list of tasks you need to complete, or things that you want to do. Most typically, they're organised in order of priority. Traditionally, they're written on a piece of paper or post it notes and acts as a memory aid.

### Prerequisites

-node pakage manager
-node js
-Web browser

### Installing

- **git clone https://github.com/Himanshu0455349/ToDoList_V-1.0**
- **cd ToDoLsit_V-1.0**
- **npm install**
- **http://localhost:3000 or http://localhost:3000/ExampleYourList**

### To submit a new feature or bugFix

Please contribute! There are plenty of good first issues to work on. To get started, you have to fork this repo to your own GitHub account first. Then open up a terminal on your machine and enter the following commands:

git clone https://github.com/Himanshu0455349/ToDoList_V-1.0
cd ToDoLsit_V-1.0
npm install
npm start

This will start the development server on http://localhost:3000/ This page should reload automatically when you make changes to the code, but no code is perfect, so sometimes you may need to restart it. :)

If you want to submit a new feature or a bugfix, the best way is to create the changes in a separate branch, e.g.: git checkout -b feature/mycoolfeature. This will make it easier for you to submit a pull request and get your feature merged.
